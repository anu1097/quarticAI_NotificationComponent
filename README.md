This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It's a simple notification component that was created as a challenge set by Quartic.Ai. This app uses socket.Io library to connect the server with client. When Connection is established it transmits fake mock notifications at random intervals.
